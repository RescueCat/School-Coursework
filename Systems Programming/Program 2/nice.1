       This manual page documents the GNU version of nice.  If no
       arguments  are  given,  nice  prints the current sheduling
       priority, which it inherited.  Otherwise,  nice  runs  the
       given  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  with its scheduling priority adjusted.  If
       no _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t is given, the priority  of  the  command  is
       incremented  by  10.  The superuser can specify a negative
       adjustment.  The priority can be adjusted by nice over the
       range of -20 (the highest priority) to 19 (the lowest).

              Add  _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t instead of 10 to the command's priority.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually 
       support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
