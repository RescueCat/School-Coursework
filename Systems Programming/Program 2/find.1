       find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

       find [path...] [expression]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of find.  find
       searches the directory tree rooted at each given  pathname
       by  evaluating  the  given  expression from left to right,
       according to the rules of precedence (see  section  OPERA-
       TORS),  until  the outcome is known (the left hand side is
       false for _a_n_d operations, true for  _o_r),  at  which  point
       find moves on to the next pathname.

       The first argument that begins with `-', `(', `)', `,', or
       `!' is taken to be the beginning of  the  expression;  any
       arguments before it are paths to search, and any arguments
       after it are the rest of the expression.  If no paths  are
       given, the current directory is used.  If no expression is
       given, the expression `-print' is used.

       find exits with status 0 if all files are  processed  suc-
       cessfully, greater than 0 if errors occur.

EEXXPPRREESSSSIIOONNSS
       The expression is made up of options (which affect overall
       operation rather than the processing of a  specific  file,
       and  always  return  true),  tests (which return a true or
       false value), and actions (which  have  side  effects  and
       return a true or false value), all separated by operators.
       -and is assumed where the operator  is  omitted.   If  the
       expression  contains  no actions other than -prune, -print
       is performed on all files  for  which  the  expression  is
       true.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       All options always return true.

       -daystart
              Measure  times  (for  -amin, -atime, -cmin, -ctime,
              -mmin, and -mtime)  from  the  beginning  of  today
              rather than from 24 hours ago.

       -depth 
              Process each directory's contents before the directory itself.

       -follow
              Dereference symbolic links.  Implies -noleaf.

       -maxdepth _l_e_v_e_l_s
              Descend at most  _l_e_v_e_l_s  (a  non-negative  integer)
              levels  of directories below the command line argu-
              ments.  `-maxdepth 0' means only  apply  the  tests
              and actions to the command line arguments.

       -mindepth _l_e_v_e_l_s
              Do  not  apply  any tests or actions at levels less
              than _l_e_v_e_l_s (a non-negative  integer).   `-mindepth
              1'  means process all files except the command line
              arguments.

       -noleaf
              Do not optimize by assuming that  directories  con-
              tain  2  fewer  subdirectories than their hard link
              count.  Each directory on a normal Unix  filesystem
              has  at  least  2  hard links: its name and its `.'
              entry.  Additionally, its subdirectories  (if  any)
              each  have  a `..'  entry linked to that directory.
              When find is examining a directory,  after  it  has
              statted 2 fewer subdirectories than the directory's
              link count, it knows that the rest of  the  entries
              in  the directory are non-directories (`leaf' files
              in the directory tree).  If only the  files'  names
              need to be examined, there is no need to stat them;
              this gives a significant increase in search  speed.
              However, this option might be needed when searching
              NFS-mounted non-Unix file systems, if they  do  not
              follow   the  directory-link  convention  described
              above.

       -version
              Print find version number on standard error.

       -xdev  
              Don't descend directories on other filesystems.

TTEESSTTSS
       Numeric arguments can be specified as

       _+_n     for greater than _n,

       _-_n     for less than _n,

       _n      for exactly _n.

       -anewer _f_i_l_e
              File was last accessed more recently than _f_i_l_e  was
              modified.   -anewer  is affected by -follow only if
              -follow comes before -anewer on the command line.

       -atime _n
              File was last accessed _n*24 hours ago.

       -cmin _n
              File's status was last changed _n minutes ago.

       -cnewer _f_i_l_e
              File's status was last changed more  recently  than
              _f_i_l_e  was modified.  -cnewer is affected by -follow
              only if -follow comes before -cnewer on the command
              line.

       -ctime _n
              File's status was last changed _n*24 hours ago.

       -empty 
              File  is  empty  and  is either a regular file or a
              directory.

       -false 
              Always false.

       -fstype _t_y_p_e
              File is on a filesystem of type  _t_y_p_e.   The  valid
              filesystem  types  vary among different versions of
              Unix; an incomplete list of filesystem  types  that
              are accepted on some version of Unix or another is:
              ufs, 4.2, 4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K, S52K.

       -gid _n 
              File's numeric group ID is _n.

       -group _g_n_a_m_e
              File belongs  to  group  _g_n_a_m_e  (numeric  group  ID
              allowed).

       -inum _n
              File has inode number _n.

       -links _n
              File has _n links.

       -lname _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              File  is a symbolic link whose contents match shell
              pattern _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  The metacharacters do  not  treat
              `/' or `.' specially.

       -mmin _n
              File's data was last modified _n minutes ago.

       -mtime _n
              File's data was last modified _n*24 hours ago.

       -name _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Base of path name (the path with the leading direc-
              tories removed) matches shell pattern _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  The
              metacharacters  (`*', `?', and `[]') do not match a
              `.' at the start of the base name.

       -newer _f_i_l_e
              File was modified more recently than _f_i_l_e.   -newer
              is affected by -follow only if -follow comes before
              -newer on the command line.

       -nouser
              No user corresponds to file's numeric user ID.

       -nogroup
              No group corresponds to file's numeric group ID.

       -path _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Path  name  matches  shell  pattern  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.   The
              metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.' specially.

       -perm _m_o_d_e
              File's  permission  bits are exactly _m_o_d_e (octal or
              symbolic).  Symbolic modes use mode 0 as a point of
              departure.

       -perm -_m_o_d_e
              All  of  the  permission  bits _m_o_d_e are set for the
              file.

       -perm +_m_o_d_e
              Any of the permission bits _m_o_d_e  are  set  for  the
              file.

       -regex _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Pathname matches regular expression _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.

       -size _n[ck]
              File  uses  _n 512-byte blocks (bytes if `c' follows
              _n, kilobytes if `k' follows _n).  The size does  not
              count  indirect  blocks,  and  does count blocks in
              sparse files that are not actually allocated.

       -true  
              Always true.

       -type _c
              File is of type _c:

              b      block (buffered) special

              c      character (unbuffered) special

              d      directory

              p      named pipe (FIFO)

              f      regular file

              l      symbolic link

              s      socket

       -uid _n 
              File's numeric user ID is _n.

       -used _n
              File was last accessed _n days after its status  was
              last changed.

       -user _u_n_a_m_e
              File  is  owned  by  user  _u_n_a_m_e  (numeric  user ID
              allowed).

       -xtype _c
              The same as -type unless the  file  is  a  symbolic
              link.   For symbolic links, if -follow has not been
              given, true if the file is a link to a file of type
              _c;  if  -follow  has  been given, true if _c is `l'.
              For symbolic links, -xtype checks the type  of  the
              file that -type does not check.

AACCTTIIOONNSS
       -exec _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ;
              Execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d; true if 0 status is returned.  All
              following arguments to find are taken to  be  arguments
              to  the command until an argument consisting
              of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}' is replaced
              by  the current pathname being processed everywhere
              it occurs in the arguments to the command, not just
              in arguments where it is alone, as in some versions
              of find.  Both of these constructions might need to
              be  escaped  (with a `\') or quoted to protect them
              from expansion by the shell.

       -fprint _f_i_l_e
              True; print the full pathname into file  _f_i_l_e.   If
              _f_i_l_e  does  not  exist when find is run, it is cre-
              ated; if it does exist, it is truncated.  The file-
              names  ``/dev/stdout'' and ``/dev/stderr'' are han-
              dled specially; they refer to the  standard  output
              and standard error output, respectively.

       -fprint0 _f_i_l_e
              True;  like -print0 but write to _f_i_l_e like -fprint.

       -fprintf _f_i_l_e _f_o_r_m_a_t
              True; like -printf but write to _f_i_l_e like  -fprint.

       -ok _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ;
              Like  -exec but ask the user first (on the standard
              input); if the response does not start with `y'  or
              `Y', do not run the command, and return false.

       -print True;  
              print the full pathname on the standard out-
              put, followed by a newline.

       -print0
              True; print the full pathname on the standard  out-
              put,  followed  by  a  null character.  This allows
              filenames that contain  newlines  to  be  correctly
              interpreted  by programs that process the find out-
              put.

       -printf _f_o_r_m_a_t
              True; print _f_o_r_m_a_t on the standard  output,  inter-
              preting  `\'  escapes  and  `%'  directives.  Field
              widths and precisions can be specified as with  the
              `printf'  C  function.  Unlike -print, -printf does
              not add a newline at the end of  the  string.   The
              escapes and directives are:

              \a     Alarm bell.

              \b     Backspace.

              \c     Stop  printing from this format immediately.

              \f     Form feed.

              \n     Newline.

              \r     Carriage return.

              \t     Horizontal tab.

              \v     Vertical tab.

              \\     A literal backslash (`\').

              A `\' character followed by any other character  is
              treated  as an ordinary character, so they both are
              printed.

              %%     A literal percent sign.

              %a     File's  last  access  time  in  the   format
                     returned by the C `ctime' function.

              %A_k    File's last access time in the format speci-
                     fied by _k, which is either `@' or  a  direc-
                     tive  for  the  C  `strftime' function.  The
                     possible values for _k are listed below; some
                     of  them  might not be available on all sys-
                     tems,  due  to  differences  in   `strftime'
                     between systems.
