1. List all of the people that you have collaborated with on this assignment. For each person indicate the level of collaboration (small, medium, large). Also write a few sentences describing what was discussed. Indicate whether you were mainly giving help or receiving help. 
	No collaboration

2. Do you think everything you did is correct? ..... 
	Everything works as intended

3. If not, give a brief description of what is working and what progress was made on the part that is not working. 

4. Comments (e.g., what were the challenges, how to make this assignment more interesting etc.): 
	No issues just several limitations because of time constraints (none of which were assignment requirements):
		echo back balance to client from server to reflect current balance
		show if deposit/withdrawal is outside of min/max range client side (shows up on server side)
		proper exit command (enter twice was as good as i could get)

5. Explain how do you handle the synchronization of threads in servers to update the account balance; 
	When the account balance is updating, that is when the thread/process is in it's critical section, so I created a mutex lock that only allows one thread at a time to update the balance. i.e.:
	 				//Lock Mutex Critical Section
                                        pthread_mutex_lock(g_mutex);

                                        //Critical Section for Deposits  
                                        *Balance = (int)*Balance + DepM;
                                        printf("New balance %d \n", (int)*Balance);

                                        //Unlock Mutex
                                        pthread_mutex_unlock(g_mutex);
