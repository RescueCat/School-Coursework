1. List all of the people that you have collaborated with on this assignment. For each person indicate the level of collaboration (small, medium, large). Also write a few sentences describing what was discussed. Indicate whether you were mainly giving help or receiving help. 
	I worked with no one on this assignment.

2. Do you think everything you did is correct? 
	Everything I finished works as intended and meets the specifications outlined on the assingment page. (http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~dzhu/cs3733/assignments/assign0.html)

3. If not, give a brief description of what is working and what progress was made on the part that is not working.
	Everything except my function for comparing doubles works. For some reason instead of keeping the largest double value it keeps the last double value inserted. I kept the line about "largest double is" out of the final report but the doubles do store to the array (checked using print statements) properly.

4. Comments (e.g., what were the challenges, how to make this assignment more interesting etc.):
	Easy solutions for such a long assignment.
